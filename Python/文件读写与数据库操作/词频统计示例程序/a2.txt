It goes without saying, but the United States Secret Service is a rather secretive group. It¡¯s understandable, though, when you have to protect the president and other high-up government officials; you can¡¯t exactly risk people knowing the ins and outs of your work.
While these men and women dressed in sunglasses and suits have long been cloaked in mystery, with a little research you can actually learn quite a bit about these brave public servants.
Just take these 21 top secret facts about the Secret Service, for instance. The next time you see them with the president, you¡¯ll know exactly what they¡¯re up to!
1. There are thousands of Secret Service agents: While you¡¯re likely to believe there are only a few men and women who operate in the Secret Service, that is untrue. In actuality, there are more like 6,500 in total.


2. They¡¯re not strictly assigned to protect presidents: In addition to the POTUS, these agents also serve and protect the?president¡¯s immediate family, former presidents, and those ex-presidents¡¯ families, too. Furthermore, they protect guests of the presidents¡ªlike the Pope.

3. There are three steps to becoming an official Secret Service agent: As with many jobs, these men and women have to work their way to the top. First, they have to work in the office for three years, followed by four to seven years of?completing different tasks. In the last step, they¡¯re either sent back to do office work or promoted to a higher position.

4. Their rigorous training includes learning to throw themselves in front of bullets and learning to survive in water: This is done in order to prepare for the worst possible situations, including shootouts and even murder attempts.
